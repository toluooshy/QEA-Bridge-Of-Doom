# QEA-Bridge-Of-Doom
Documentation of my QEA1 Project.

### The Write-Up
The Write-Up is in 'QEA Robo Write-Up.pdf'.

### Pre-Defined Velocities
If you want to run the script 'BridgeOfDoomQEA2020.m' (this makes the Neato move) it needs arguments 'Vl' and 'Vr' passed into it. The vectors loaded in 'vL_T.mat' and 'vR_T.mat' are where you can find variables necessary to properly run the bridge transversing script. Alternatively they can be generated in 'BridgeOfDoomPlot.mlx', but you may run into errors due to the second half. Reading all the comments is therefore important.

### Pre-Defined Encoder Data
The file 'BODtrial.mat' contains the necessary data for Experimental Evaluation.

### Images
This repository also contains saved png's of the plots from the write-up.
